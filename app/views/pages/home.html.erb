			<h1> Black Voodoo Pin</h1>

			<p>This site will act as an online social experience where you create and edit other peopleâ€™s profiles. Essentially it's Facebook turned on its ass. </p>
			<p>BlackVoodooPin.com gives users the ability to create digital voodoo dolls for anyone. This site will offer the ability to create a custom doll, from looks, to name and doll location. Then, users anonymously place pins into the doll and type in whatever they are thinking about that person.
